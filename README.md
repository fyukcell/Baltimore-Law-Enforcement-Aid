Baltimore Law Enforcement Aid web application developed for Cloud Software Development course using Java EE


1. As a team of five students, we developed a cloud software application to assist Baltimore law enforcement officers to track recent 911 calls and crime alerts.
2. We employed the Java EE platform with GlassFish, PrimeFaces, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
